### My game is based on the [game](https://github.com/eli-game-dev/multiplayer-tutorial-unity) we learned in the lesson

### Added:
* Weapon for the player - by adding a [Gun script](https://github.com/LeveI-Up/Multi_Player_Gun_Ex10/blob/main/Assets/scripts/Player/Gun.cs)
* Shooting effects by using Particle System
* A ReyCast which is synchronized with the camera beam

* This game using photon components to allow multiplayer play
